Introduce ourselves and what we accomplished
  - "Hi we are Minecraft group A, and this is our Ted Talk"

Central idea is to give Minecraft Players the tools to start collecting
their game data and the tools to analyze it.

Our project hosts a Python kernel with popular libraries including Pandas
SKlearn, and Numpy.

Players can use the event selection pillbox to select events they want to
listen to in game.

This enables players to play with the events that they collect in the game.
